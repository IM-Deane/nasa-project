### Version History

**Version 0.0.2**

Added planet data to API. The data has been retrieved from the NASA
[kepler exoplanet dataset](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/data.html).

The data is stored in a csv file and so a read/write stream was used to parse
the file.

**Version 0.0.1**

Added app boilerplate.
